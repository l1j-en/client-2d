# client

Fully open source, written from scratch client using legally available graphics 
compatible with l1j servers.

The first/primary version of this will be using orthographic 2d graphics.  I 
will put some small amount of effort to make the graphics exchangable in case
I later want to try isometric.  As of this moment, I know of no complete and
freely/cheaply available isometric graphics to use though.  Flare art comes 
close, but it's still not enough.  

The client will be able to run as a desktop application or html5 client.  
It's built in to be able to run as a mobile app too but I don't feel this style
of game will work well on a phone so this will get little attention.
